The iissues I found with the previous code, were found in two different files.
Inside the CSS file, there were about 2-4 spelling errors and an extra semicolon.
The Java script had a few spelling erros, along with missing parenthesis. 

By using the dev tools, it was easy to navigate where the issues were, allowing me to go back 
and fix it. It helps a lot so see where specifically the errors are, pretty silly how a few
spelling errors and minor missing components can affect a webpage. Though this probably wasn't as 
extreme as other debugging issues, it was nice to learn and see what I could change and view with 
the DevTools.
